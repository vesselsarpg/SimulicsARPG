»INTRODUCTION 

Simulics can come in many shapes and sizes; however, they are predominantly seen to be of bipedal form, ranging from five to eight feet in height. In contrast to most creatures being born, Simulics appear to be crafted by another creature of an entirely different species, but oddly, of the same genetic base components. These elusive, creating creatures have been dubbed the Nekroviss, due to their tendency to use any surrounding organic compounds, including the bodies of those who have expired. No one knows how the Nekroviss are formed, but it’s assumed they reproduce among themselves in a similar way to Earth’s coral. 



»GENERAL INFORMATION 

Simulics are canidesque, bipedal creatures with some clear insectoid features (noticeably the tail). 

-Depending on what materials and compounds were used to craft each individual, odd mutations may occur, accompanied by anatomical changes in some cases. (Ie, glands for those of a toxic mutation). 

-Due to a shortage of viable materials, most, if not all, Simulics are crafted with an imperfect form, resulting in an unstable patch or body part that struggles to hold form effectively. As all Simulics have the ability to temporarily mimic other organic forms, these unstable parts will remain unchanged when taking on another form, rendering their stealth aspect useless. 

-A perfectly formed Simulic can use their abilities to hunt (or mingle, if they would rather not) among those of another species undetected. 

-Simulics are born with no gender (nor parts to accompany) and tend to use whatever pronoun they feel appropriate; however, the favoured tends to be ‘it’. 



»BEHAVIOUR 

-To all other species but their own, Simulics tend to take on the offensive stance. Among themselves, it depends on individual personalities. 

-Though predominantly hostile, Simulics can form something similar to a friendship with other species - though this may cause a negative effect from members of their own. 

-Simulics themselves can not reproduce, as they quite frankly lack the anatomy to do so. Despite this, and their renowned hostile nature, odd social behaviours have formed in which two (or more) act as companions, hunting for and with said individuals. 

-Simulics tend to be drawn to electrical items, be it computers, lights, or even animatronics. The electrical currents seem to spark destructive natures, and they will dismantle any electrical item in a matter of minutes in order to consume the components and get a kick from the shocks.

 -Human culture, despite the lack of it where the Simulics originate from, can influence individuals. Whereas most learn from those in Space Stations or other outerspace facilities, there have been a few Simulics that were Earth-born from stray Nekroviss pods that have ingrained their way into human habitats. Noticeably, these Simulics are more tolerant of humans, and some will go as far as to strive to be them.</p>
