          <p>FILE TRANSFER : COMPLETE</p> 

<p>WE WERE WRONG - PLAYBACK UNAVAILABLE 
"This is.. Dr. Yoshiro... Although, at this point, you might as well know me as Lawrence. We've set up base on a dead planet, or rather, we thought it was dead. There are these things; they look like plants, but they're not. We harvested some to study; half the time, it felt as if it was studying us. As if they were studying us. The first casualty was Rover, the base's dog. I guess that's what started it all. I guess that's what made us first on the menu. We thought we had killed it, but we didn't - we weren't even close."</p>

<p>The discovery was an accident, an outer space research facility stumbled across the perfect candidate for setting up a grounded base - a perfectly dead planet, too barren to sustain any native life, or so it was suspected. The only thing marking the bare horizon was an orchard of twisted, black tree-like structures. Oblivious to what the scientists had stumbled across, they took several cuttings of the trees inside to study - only this proved to be a fatal decision, and perhaps even the start of what formed the Simulics we know today. The 'trees' were aptly dubbed the Nekroviss, harvesting any and all organic material and minerals, be it with or without a pulse, within reach of its tendril-like branches. Much to the horror of the staff, the Nekroviss began to spread throughout the building like weeds - microscopic spores sticking to clothing, tools, and various other platforms that had come into contact with the original.</p>

<p>IN DEATH, LIFE FLOURISHES - PLAYBACK UNAVAILABLE</p>


<p>"It's.. Day five at this point. We've lost about a quarter of our staff to the outbreak, resulting in a complete and total lockdown of the base. It's quarantine, and I'm the only one watching it. We've managed to rid ourselves of most of the young Nekroviss, and the original plant..no..creature, itself appears to be dwindling in strength. No spores have been produced from what we could determine; it seems to be dormant - hiding something, as silly as that sounds. There's something in there, there has to be. Shoot- it moved, what is that? What is that?!"</p>

<p>Amongst the wall of tendrils, something emerged, something which seemed that it itself couldn't decide what it was, or what it was supposed to be. It looked decidedly canine, though somewhat humanoid in stature - four eyes marking its inhuman face. Its form seemed influenced by those it's creator had consumed, it could even speak..sort of. This marked the first generation of what would become modern Simulics. For the most part, this individual was studied, examined - though it seemed to do the same right back to those who looked at it. The original Nekroviss was destroyed by the individual, almost instinctively upon it's first life-sign, most likely in fear of being consumed.</p>

<p>Though hostile at first, a friendship of sorts was formed between the creature and Lawrence, and it's clear that the creature began to pick up human behaviours, specifically his voice patterns and mannerisms. The mimicking ability first became clear when the creature picked up a little more than just behaviours. Upon being given an item of Lawrence's clothing, it seemed to be able to map the human's DNA - rather easily, considering that it was originally comprised of human material to start with. Lawrence soon found himself staring back at an identical copy; the only thing to tell them apart was a small, smoky gash on the copy's hand - most likely inflicted due to a slight shortage of resources. </p>

<p> It's unclear how exactly both the Nekroviss and the Simulics made their way to Earth, as any and all logs, be it data or voice, appear to be either corrupted beyond repair or deleted. Theories suggest that the creature killed and stole the identity of Lawrence Yoshiro; others suggest that they were in on it together, or that it was all an unfortunate accident caused by a misjudgement of procedures. Regardless of what happened, it's evident that both alien species have occupied certain corners of suburban areas, cities and anywhere with a steady flow of people.
Though many Simulic communities shy away from the eyes of humans, other, more ambitious members of the species choose to infiltrate and hunt (or even live among) them. (Writing Credits @Hypodriive)</p>
